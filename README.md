## *Y U No Redux??!1*
I have decided against using an external state management solution to become more comfortable with React itself. 
At some point I noticed that I was spending too much time figuring out Redux for very small learning projects, that [don't benefit from extended state management anyway](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/you-might-not-need-redux-be46360cf367).

While I clearly see the benefit of using Redux or Mobx, I'd like to stick to one rabbit for this project. I will migrate this to Redux after having finished it. The comparison will probably be very insightful.
